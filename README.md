During my data analyst training at Brainnest, I had the opportunity to work on a project that aimed to analyze and predict heart disease using statistic tools 
and machine learning techniques. The project involved exploring a large dataset containing various clinical and demographic features of patients with and without heart disease. 
We pre-processed and cleaned the dataset to prepare it for training machine learning models.
